My version of the "Working" [Stargate MK II](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1603423) created by [Glitch](https://www.thingiverse.com/Glitch/about).

Rough list of changes made by me.
*   I rewrote most of the arduino code.
*   I merged some of the ideas from [Carasibana](
    https://www.thingiverse.com/Carasibana/about)'s [version](
    https://www.thingiverse.com/make:104604) and another build I can no longer
    find on thingiverse. This second one is where I got the audio parts.

Some videos of my completed build:

I no longer have this gate. I donated it to a Stargate focused charity auction.
I plan to build a new one eventually.

Note: I am no claiming ownership of all the work in this repository, specifically the design.
